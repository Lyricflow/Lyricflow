And it means something special to me  
Look at the way that she smiles when she sees me  
How lucky can one fellow be?  
  
She's just my kind of girl, she makes me feel fine  
Who could ever believe that she could be mine?  
She's just my kind of girl, without her I'm blue  
And if she ever leaves me what could I do, what could I do?  
  
And when we go for a walk in the park  
And she holds me and squeezes my hand  
We'll go on walking for hours and talking  
About all the things that we plan  
  
She's just my kind of girl, she makes me feel fine  
Who could ever believe that she could be mine?  
She's just my kind of girl, without her I'm blue

Hiding their shame behind hollow laughter

Pity Cassandra that no one believed you  
But then again you were lost from the start  
Now we must suffer and sell our secrets  
Bargain, playing smart, aching in our hearts  
  
Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood  
Now the last day is dawning  
Some of us wanted but none of us would  
Listen to words of warning  
But on the darkest of nights  
Nobody knew how to fight  
And we were caught in our sleep  
Sorry Cassandra I didn't believe  
You really had the power  
I only saw it as dreams you would weave  
Until the final hour  
  
So in the morning your ship will be sailing  
Now that your father and sister are gone  
There is no reason for you to linger  
You're grieving deeply but still moving on  
  
You know the future is casting a shadow  
No one else sees it but you know your fate  
Packing your bags, being slow and thorough  
Knowing, though you're late, that ship is sure to wait  
  
Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood  
Now the last day is dawning  
Some of us wanted but none of us would

Sorry Cassandra I didn't believe  
You really had the power  
I only saw it as dreams you would weave  
Until the final hour  
  
I watched the ship leaving harbor at sunrise  
Sails almost slack in the cool morning rain  
She stood on deck, just a tiny figure  
Rigid and restrained, blue eyes filled with pain

I was blind but now I see  
Then you smiled and you took my hand

And one of them is my brother Joe  
He's been gone for a long, long time

I love hearing the stories that they tell  
They've seen places beyond my land and they've found new horizons  
They speak strangely but I understand  
  
And I dream I'm an eagle  
And I dream I can spread my wings  
Flying high, high, I'm a bird in the sky  
I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze  
High, high, what a feeling to fly  
Over mountains and forests and seas  
And to go anywhere that I please  
  
As all good friends we talk all night, and we fly wing to wing  
I have questions and they know everything  
There's no limit to what I feel, we climb higher and higher  
Am I dreaming or is it all real?  
  
Is it true I'm an eagle?  
Is it true I can spread my wings?  
Flying high, high, I'm a bird in the sky (I'm an eagle)  
I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze  
High, high, what a feeling to fly (What a feeling)

If I had to do the same again  
I would, my friend, Fernando

I would, my friend, Fernando

And since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand  
Can you hear the drums Fernando?  
Do you still recall the frightful night we crossed the Rio Grande?  
I can see it in your eyes  
How proud you were to fight for freedom in this land

Sleep is waiting round the bend  
While you travel through the milky way

Curtins rustling in the breeze

Daylight makes it's way into my mind  
Coming through  
Yet another morning without you.

Casting shadows on the walls  
In the twilight hour I am alone  
Sitting near the fireplace  
Dying embers warm my face  
In this peaceful solitude

Everything comes backs to me again

Seeing long forgotten scenes

Playing games within my mind  
Like the embers as they die

And it all comes back to me tonight

(And when you're feeling so bad)  
And you think you're cursed  
(And you've got it sad)  
Well, if there's one thing for the better that can turn you loose  
  
It's gotta be rock'n roll  
To fill the hole in your soul  
There's gotta be rock'n roll  
To fill the hole in your soul  
  
My friend Sam is a chauffeur, Annie goes to school  
Jerry works at the office, Sue lies by the pool  
But on all weekends  
(Together again)  
When I meet my friends  
(I'm gonna see them now)  
And we're lookin' round for the action we sure play it cool  
  
It's gotta be rock'n roll  
To fill the hole in your soul  
There's gotta be rock'n roll  
To fill the hole in your soul  
  
You paint your world and use all colors  
And then you find it all comes out too bright  
You know it's only a lie  
The songs you sing are too romantic  
And when you want the truth  
They only spit in your eye  
Oh yeah, they're only telling you lies  
Oh yeah, there's gotta be rock'n roll  
To fill the hole in your soul  
  
You feel bad, let me tell you, we all get the blues  
Sometimes life is a burden, weighed down in your shoes  
When it's bad, worse, worst  
(You know you're feeling so bad)  
And you think you're cursed  
(And you've got it sad)  
Well, if there's one thing for the better that can turn you loose

I let my feelings take over  
Carry my soul away, into the world  
Where beauty meets the darkness of the day  
  
Where my mind is like an open window  
Where the high and healing winds blow  
From my shallow sleep the sounds awake me  
I let them take me  
  
Let it be a joke, let it be a smile  
Let it be a farce, if it makes me laugh for a little while  
Let it be a tear, let it be a sigh  
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry  
  
Some streets are emptiness, dry leaves of autumn  
Rustling down an old alley  
And in the dead of night, I find myself a blind man  
In some ancient valley  
I let the music speak, leading me gently  
Urging me like a lover  
Leading me all the way, into a place  
Where beauty will defeat the darkest day  
  
Where I'm one with every grand illusion  
No disturbance, no intrusion  
Where I let the wistful sounds seduce me  
I let them use me  
  
Let it be a joke, let it be a smile  
Let it be a farce, if it makes me laugh for a little while

Seeing long forgotten scenes  
So the present runs into the past

Playing games within my mind  
Like the embers as they die

And a sense of guilt I can't deny  
What happened to the wonderful adventures  
The places I had planned for us to go  
Well, some of that we did, but most we didn't

Who found out that nothing can capture a heart  
Like a melody can?  
Well, whoever it was, I'm a fan  
  
So I say  
Thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing  
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing  
Who can live without it, I ask in all honesty  
What would life be?  
Without a song or a dance what are we?  
So I say thank you for the music  
For giving it to me  
  
I've been so lucky, I am the girl with golden hair  
I wanna sing it out to everybody  
What a joy, what a life, what a chance!  
  
So I say  
Thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing  
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing  
Who can live without it, I ask in all honesty

My train, I'm certain, left the station just when it was due  
I must have read the morning paper going into town  
And having gotten through the editorial, no doubt I must have frowned  
I must have made my desk around a quarter after nine  
With letters to be read, and heaps of papers waiting to be signed  
I must have gone to lunch at half past twelve or so  
The usual place, the usual bunch  
And still on top of this I'm pretty sure it must have rained  
The day before you came  
  
I must have lit my seventh cigarette at half past two  
And at the time I never even noticed I was blue  
I must have kept on dragging through the business of the day  
Without really knowing anything, I hid a part of me away  
At five I must have left, there's no exception to the rule  
A matter of routine, I've done it ever since I finished school  
The train back home again  
Undoubtedly I must have read the evening paper then  
Oh yes, I'm sure my life was well within its usual frame  
The day before you came  
  
I must have opened my front door at eight o'clock or so  
And stopped along the way to buy some Chinese food to go  
I'm sure I had my dinner watching something on TV  
There's not, I think, a single episode of Dallas that I didn't see  
I must have gone to bed around a quarter after ten  
I need a lot of sleep, and so I like to be in bed by then  
I must have read a while  
The latest one by Marilyn French or something in that style  
It's funny, but I had no sense of living without aim  
The day before you came  
  
And turning out the light  
I must have yawned and cuddled up for yet another night  
And rattling on the roof I must have heard the sound of rain  
The day before you came

Slightly worn but dignified and not too old for sex  
We're still striving for the sky  
No taste for humble pie  
Thanks for all your generous love and thanks for all the fun  
Neither you nor I'm to blame when all is said and done

How you rise, shake your head, get up and ask for more  
Clear-headed and open-eyed  
With nothing left untried  
Standing calmly at the crossroads,no desire to run  
There's no hurry any more when all is said and done

Where nothing ever happened?

And when the whole gang bangs  
Then what is your excuse?  
I got the fever, fever, fever, fever  
Fever gives you lust with an appetite  
It hits you like the fangs  
From a rattlesnake bite  
Yeah we're all here  
'Cause we're not all there tonight  
We can't run away from trouble  
There ain't no place that far  
But if we do it right at the speed of light  
There's the backseat of my car - caviar  
I was feelin' so high I forgot what day  
Now I'm feeling low down  
Even slow feels way to fast  
And now the booze don't work  
'Cause the drugs ran out of gas  
I got the fever, fever, fever, fever  
The buzz that you're gettin'  
From the crack don't last  
I'd rather be O.D.in' on the crack of her ass  
Yeah we're all here  
'Cause we're not all there tonight  
My first time ever lover  
We fell asleep out on the lawn  
And when I woke up I was all alone  
Making love to the crack of dawn  
So yo, I beg yo pardon sir  
The gangster of love rides again  
You know I gotta chill  
It gimme such a thrill  
Like a burnin' plague  
Yeah get outta my way  
Fever may be Hell and a cross to bear  
As long as I'm in heaven, honey I don't care  
You look so good baby, look so fine  
I tell you you're the image of a perfect crime  
You get so tired holdin' on so tight  
If you think you're goin' crazy  
Well you may be right

While drinking all they wanted to.  
A bitter sweet, this final evening,  
Before he must leave her side...  
  
They danced around the glass filled tables  
While fiddlers played so sweet and low.  
Their eyes hard fixed upon each other,  
However would she let him go?  
And when the time it came upon them,  
She said in case we forget...  
  
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.  
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.  
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.  
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.  
  
The letters came and every single Sunday  
We all would wait to hear the news.  
She knew her love would be home someday,  
The only thing she held on to.  
We sang a song just like we used to  
And she said before we could leave...  
  
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.  
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.  
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.  
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.  
  
That night she heard her true love calling  
With words that only she could know.  
They held each other till the morning  
And when it was his time to go.  
She said...

You walked away from me  
Leaving me all black and blue  
  
Broken in two because of you  
I feel like I've been beaten  
You walked away from me  
Leaving me all black and blue

You walked away having me all black and blue.

And the wild fire lets you go.

Take me away, take me away  
Take me away  
Do you dream fantasy and believe what you see is weird  
I need a remedy or a book to get off this fear  
All I wanted to know is how do I get the truth from here.  
We play so small a part  
But we started from somewhere  
  
All the friends that I can think of  
Know what's going to happen to them  
If they don't think on today and plan ahead for their tomorrow  
Here we are just lucky children breaking out of the shell  
I'll take your hand today and love you till we reach  
  
The end of the line  
Reach the end of the line  
Reach the end of the line  
Reach the end of the line

The pillars of the temple,  
In these hills of green  
Buried deep inside for only us to find

The power of the sun  
The strength of a thousand bows  
And those who near it again, will fear it again

Painted in the sky was the moment to awake  
All that lay within you,  
As this dawn should break  
With this force awoken, none can stand before  
This is the hour, now is the time  
Driven by the purest love, I give you mine  
All that we must be, is everything we see

And it's our love that will go on forever

And being with you now is the only  
Thought that's strong,  
It's a lonely night, and I'm trying  
To hold on...

That we must know we must enter  
This is love, this is love, only love  
When the dove is descended  
  
You are the winding stream going to somewhere  
That we' ve never seen  
You, are the dare to dream and the silent scream  
And the final prayer

Cry out for the shadow of the sun
